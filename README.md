# Scripts at Wireless Battle of the Mesh v9

These are scripts I wrote during [WBMv9](http://battlemesh.org/) relating to flashing OpenWrt (locally or globally) over the network and attempting to automate updating U-Boot on [TP-Link WDR4300](https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr4300) devices in order to use [U-Boot_mod](https://github.com/pepe2k/u-boot_mod).
